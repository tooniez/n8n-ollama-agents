# n8n Ollama Agents

**n8n Ollama Agents** a collection of my used credentials and workflows with Ollama.

See [INFO.md](INFO.md) for upstream details.

## üß© Components

- **n8n**: Low-code automation platform
- **Ollama**: Cross-platform LLM runner
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for AI applications
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store, used for caching and session management
- **Supabase**: Open-source alternative to Firebase, used for real-time data sync and storage

## üõ† Project Workflow

1. **Setup**: The Docker Compose file initializes all necessary services.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Use n8n workflows to load data into Qdrant or Supabase.
3. **AI Processing**: Leverage Ollama for local LLM inference within n8n workflows.
4. **Workflow Creation**: Build custom AI agents and RAG systems using n8n's visual editor.
5. **Integration**: Connect your AI workflows with external services and APIs.
6. **Execution**: Run your workflows on-demand or on a schedule within the self-hosted environment.

## üöÄ Connecting to localhost services

When integrating with other services running on your local machine (outside of the Docker network), use the special DNS name `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`. This allows containers to communicate with services on your host machine.

For example, if you have a service running on port 3000 on your local machine, you would access it from within a container using:


```shell
http://host.docker.internal
```

## Included Workflows

## Getting Started

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Backup and Restore

Workflow and Credential backups are stored in `./backups` and can be restored using the `n8n-restore` container.
### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

### Backup

```shell
docker compose up n8n-backup
```

### Restore
##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable
in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```shell
docker compose up n8n-restore
```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Upgrading

* ### For Nvidia GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

* ### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

```
docker compose pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

* ### For Non-GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose --profile cpu pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
