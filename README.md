## ðŸš€ Connecting to localhost services

When integrating with other services running on your local machine (outside of the Docker network), use the special DNS name `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`. This allows containers to communicate with services on your host machine.

For example, if you have a service running on port 3000 on your local machine, you would access it from within a container using:


```shell
http://host.docker.internal
```
